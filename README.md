We all know Redux is the best, and that component internal state is for suckers.

This tool determines the number of mentions of `setState` you have in your repository divided by the total number JavaScript/TypeScript source code lines. The lower the ratio of setState mentions to the total number of lines in your repository, the higher your purity percentage. Ideally, you'll reach the holy grail of NO `setState` mentions, otherwise known as PURE REDUX.

P.S. Yes, I'm aware that even Dan Abramov himself advocates for the use of component internal state. Clearly he has not seen the light of purity inherent in his own creation! PURE REDUX FOREVER.

## Usage:

`npm install pure-redux -g`

Navigate to your source directory and run `pure-redux`.
